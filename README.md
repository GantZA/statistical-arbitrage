<br />
TBD: Need to simulate Min_t statistics to obtain empirical distribution<br />
<br />
Will publish working constrained mean test shortly
<br />
Test for Statistical Arbitrage (modified definition) following the methodology in Hogan et al. (2004) and Jarrow et al. (2012).
<br />
test_stat_arb.jl contains relevant code to obtain MLE parameters for profit process, the rest is an implementation of online-learning zero-cost expert-based investment strategies
